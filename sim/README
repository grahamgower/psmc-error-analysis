Procedure undertaken:
1) simulate data using SCRM (sim.sh)
2) fragment simulated data and convert to psmc/msmc formats (frag.sh)
3) run psmc (psmc.sh)
4) run msmc (msmc.sh)

Noting that msmc cannot observe homozygous regions following the last
segregating site in an input file, we also truncate psmc input in the same
way and run psmc on the truncated input.

The final output is parsed and dumped to a gzipped .tsv with psmcr-sim-dump.R.
